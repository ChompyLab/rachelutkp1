                Hey there! I’m Rachel, and here’s some cool design facts about me!
                <ul>
                  <li>I love getting to make things every day!</li>
                  <li>My design aesthetic is super colorful and playful.</li>
                  <li>I'm inspired by video games, toys, art pieces, books/comics, clothing/accessories, and more.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Contrary to the haters, I LOVE Comic Sans. I also have wayyy too many fonts saved to my computer.
            </p>

                  I don't have an early design memory. I know that I always enjoyed art class because we got to make different kinds of art. 
                  <br><br>
                  Generally speaking, I’ve always loved making things out of whatever material I could get my hands on. That’s never changed.

              I’d define interaction design as a created experience. It’s something that leads users through a space, both physical and digital,
              with some kind of goal in mind.

                Print product design involves using design skills for a static object. 
                You can make it 3D in some ways and engineer a sort of experience, but it’s not ideal for super dynamic projects.

                  Digital products may be more complex and could be more game-like in a sense, with a bigger emphasis on user experience. 
                  There’s an added layer of functionality that allows you to create movement that is otherwise near-impossible in print.

                The last time I saw a surprising digital design was probably the 
                <a href = "https://welcomehome.fandom.com/wiki/Welcome_Home_Wiki">“Welcome Home” ARG.</a>
                It’s a website with a story that’s still being worked out, and there’s a ton of hidden easter eggs. 
                <br><br>
                
                It forces the user to navigate throughout the pages to find codes and such to discover more of the story. 
                I think getting to work on a project like that would be super cool!

                <li>My dog</li>

            <br>
            I'm into anything Marvel, DC, or gaming. I also love fantasy and science fiction.
            <br><br>
            Despite the limited color palette on this site, I love using tons of vibrant colors in my work.
            The more whimsical, the better.
            <br><br>
            I love pulling references from all sorts of media. 
            Doesn't matter if it's fiction, history, or a fun fact. I'll probably find a way to include it ;)
